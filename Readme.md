Node Todo
===========

A little todo app


Description
---------------
John Duff (http://github.com/jduff) started writing his own todo app using Rails 3. 
I decided to see how hard it would be to do the same using nodejs and express.

It's a work in progress

Much thanks to John for giving me the css and fiddly bits so I could get going!


Requirements
-------------------

 * node.js 
 * mongodb (soon!)


Installation
--------------

    git clone git://github.com/glongman/node-todo.git
    cd node-todo

    # Update submodules
    git submodule update --init --recursive

    # Copy the default configuration file and edit as you please.
    cp config/app_config.js.sample config/app_config.js
